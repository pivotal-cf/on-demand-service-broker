# on-demand-service-broker
A Cloud Foundry generic on demand service broker.

This is an on-demand broker designed to take advantage of BOSH 2.0 features such
as IP management and global cloud configuration.

In production, this application is deployed via a BOSH release. See its
[repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/on-demand-service-broker-release) for more
details.

This repository is the broker implementation. To build a service that uses the broker, see the [on-demand-services-sdk](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/on-demand-services-sdk)

## User Documentation

User documentation can be found [here](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb). Documentation is targeted at service authors wishing to deploy their services on-demand and operators wanting to offer services on-demand.

## Development

### How are dependencies managed?
We only deploy this application with BOSH. Its dependencies are vendored as submodules
into the [BOSH release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/on-demand-service-broker-release).

### Go dependencies
Go dependencies are managed by dep.

To fetch dependencies use
```
dep ensure
dep prune
```

To update an individual dependency use
```
dep ensure -update <dependency-path>
dep prune
```

### Configuration
This app is configured with a config file, the path to which should be supplied on
the command line: `on-demand-broker -configFilePath /some/file.yml`.

An example configuration file is `config/test_assets/good_config.yml`.

You will need to upload a
service release for example a [Redis release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/redis-example-service-release)
to your BOSH director.

### Running tests
You can make use of the script in `scripts/run-tests.sh` to run tests skipping system tests.

#### Running Systests
In order to run the systests you must set the environment variable that are
listed in system_tests/.envrc.template. The values for these variables can be
taken from the pipeline.yml and adjusted for your local environment

### Dev / test tools
* go 1.8
* [counterfeiter](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter) (for re-generating fakes)
* CF CLI (for system tests. See below)

### What's in that system_tests directory?
Black-box tests designed to be run against this broker, a real BOSH director and
a real Cloud Foundry.
